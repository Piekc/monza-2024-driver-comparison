# F1 Driver Lap Time Comparison using FastF1

Hi again! I'm PÃ­a ðŸŒ¸ I'm 18 and currently studying engineering â€” and honestly, Iâ€™ve been super obsessed with Formula 1 lately. This little project is part of my learning journey in motorsport analytics.

This time, I made a script that compares two F1 drivers' lap times during the **2024 Italian Grand Prix in Monza**.  
I picked **Yuki Tsunoda** (my favorite ðŸ’™) and **Max Verstappen** (who's super consistent and fast), just to compare how their performance looked lap-by-lap.

## What this project does

- Loads real race data using [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/)
- Filters lap data for two drivers
- Detects and marks:
  - **Fastest lap** for each driver (red dot)
  - **Pit stop laps** (purple Xs)
- Generates a graph showing lap time vs lap number for each driver

This is just an example â€” you can totally change the drivers and analyze anyone you like!

## Technologies used

- Python 3.12  
- FastF1 (latest version)  
- Matplotlib (for graphs)  
- VS Code (I love it for coding lol)

## What I learned

- How to filter and visualize multiple data sets at once  
- How to plot race performance clearly  
- How to detect key moments like pits and best laps  
- And mostly, how exciting it is to explore data from F1 races

##  Output example

Here's an example of what the chart looks like:

## How to run it

1. Open the option "New Terminal" on python
2. Install FastF1: pip install -U fastf1
3. Once installed fastf1 write on the terminal
